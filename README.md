## INFO

This project was created using the following technologies:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React.js
- MongoDB Atlas
- Mongoose
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This project serves as a demonstration of the skills learned through the 4 month SENG 4640 course at Thompson Rivers University. The project is a simple pet store application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete pets from a database. The application is built using the MERN stack and is deployed on a local server. The application is built using the MVC design pattern and is split into two main components: the client and the server. The client is built using React.js and is responsible for the front-end of the application. The server is built using Node.js and Express.js and is responsible for the back-end of the application. The server is connected to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The application is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS. The application is deployed on a local server and is accessible through a web browser. 

The grade I received for this program was A+

## How to run the application
Tested on SENG-Lab 1791 Workstation 19 using PowerShell.

Unzip the code and navigate to the directory /lists and run the following commands:

    - npm install
    - npm run build

Navigate to the directory /server and run the following commands:

The console should read "Listening on port 3000" go the localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.
